----------------------------------------------------------

- Model is state
    - everything going on a screen as a container of states, 
    isLoading, isChecked becomes model

- State View Intention

- State, View, Intention, User

- user interacts with ui (pull to refresh)
- user has Intention to refresh screen
- changes occur via background logic
- any change of State can only happen by firing an Intent
- new state is rendered in View
