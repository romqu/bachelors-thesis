% - at existing solution
% - what they might do badly
% - solution or goal is to develop a framework


\newpage
In order to overcome the mentioned problem, the aim will be to take a deeper look at what is important to understand and successfully implement MVI.
For this it is essential to get a better overview over archhitectural patterns in general. Before this can be done meaningfully the first step must be 
to analyze why they came to life in the first place and what the exact motivation was. Further the problem they try to solve should be layed out in more detail to 
get the bigger picture. In order to do justice to that, it is a necessity to review the history of architectural patterns and to work out how they have evolved over time.
By doing that it will also be possible to track down the issues that each of this architectural patterns brings with it.
\\

After this is accomplished, the next step is to study the origins of Model-View-Intent. The beginning is made by the JavaScript library React and the application architecture
Flux, which introduced the concept of the unidirectional flow for building user interfaces. It is necessary to clarify which idea is hidden behind it and what it does
better than previous solutions. All components of this framework should be examined and shortly explained. Following on from this, a further improvement(?) of Flux will 
be discussed: Redux. Differences to the idea and terminology of Flux will be pointed out and evaluated.

Since Mode-View-Intent takes some of its inspiration regarding its structure from Mode-View-Cotroller, it is imperative (crucial?) to dedicate a section to it as well.
In this section, the similarities and differences will be identified and illustrated to get a better grasp, as to why it served as a source of inspiration.
